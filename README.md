Recipe Sharing Website: Create a platform where users can share their favorite recipes,
search for recipes by specific ingredients, and save those they want to try. You could
implement advanced search functionality and recipe ratings.
1. Planning and Design: Before diving into coding, it's important to plan and design
the structure of your web application. Define the main requirements such as user
registration, recipe uploading, ingredient-based recipe search, saving favorite
recipes, and adding ratings. You can use tools like use case diagrams and
flowcharts to assist you in the design process.
2. Setup Development Environment: Make sure you have a proper development
environment set up to start working on your project. This may involve installing a
code editor such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm and using a web
development framework such as Django, Flask, or Ruby on Rails.
3. Backend Development: Start by developing the backend of your web
application. This involves setting up a database (MySQL) to store recipes and
user information, as well as writing APIs to handle operations like creating,
reading, updating, and deleting recipes. If you're using Python, you might
consider using Django or Flask to streamline backend development.
4. Frontend Development: Once the backend is complete, focus on developing the
frontend of your web application. This includes designing and implementing the
user interface to allow users to interact with the site. You can use HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript to create web pages and utilize frontend frameworks like React,
Angular, or Vue.js to simplify development.
5. Implementing Core Features: After completing the basic backend and frontend,
start implementing the core features of your web application. This may include
creating forms for adding new recipes, creating pages for viewing recipes,
implementing search functionality for ingredients, and allowing users to save
favorite recipes.
6. Testing and Debugging: Make sure to thoroughly test your web application to
identify and fix any bugs or issues. You can use testing tools like pytest for the
backend and Jest or Cypress for the frontend.
7. Deployment: Finally, when your web application is ready to be published, you
can set up a production server and deploy your application. You can use hosting
services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean to host your web application.

Name of the Application: CookBook Community
Short Description: CookBook Community is a web platform where users can share,
discover, and save their favorite recipes. Users can search for recipes by specific
ingredients, explore advanced search options, rate recipes, and save them for future
reference.
Functional Requirements:
● User Registration: Users should be able to create accounts on the platform.
● Add Recipe: Registered users can upload their own recipes, including ingredients,
instructions, and images.
● Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by entering specific ingredients or
keywords.
● Advanced Search: Advanced search options should allow users to filter recipes by
categories (e.g., cuisine type, meal type, dietary restrictions).
● Recipe Viewing: Users can view detailed information about each recipe, including
ingredients, instructions, and ratings.
● Recipe Rating: Registered users can rate recipes and leave reviews.
● Save Recipes: Users can save recipes to their profile for future reference.
● User Profile: Each user should have a profile page where they can view their saved
recipes and manage their account settings.
● Admin Panel: An admin panel should be available for managing user accounts,
moderating uploaded recipes,editing recipes,deleting, and handling reported content.
Non-Functional Requirements:
● Performance: The website should be responsive and load quickly, even with a large
number of users and recipes.
● Security: User passwords should be securely hashed and stored. The platform
should have measures in place to prevent unauthorized access and protect user
data.
● User-Friendly Interface: The website should have an intuitive and visually appealing
interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the platform.
● Scalability: The architecture should be designed to accommodate future growth and
an increasing number of users and recipes.
● Accessibility: The website should be accessible to users with disabilities, following
best practices for web accessibility standards. (to check)
